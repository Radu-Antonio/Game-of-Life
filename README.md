# Game-of-Life
I did an implementation of Conway's Game of Life using python
You can learn more about it here: [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

# How to run it:
- you need to have pygame, if you dont have it type pip install pygame
- type python GOL.py and play with it

# How to use it:
- draw the initial state using the left mouse button, if you want to remove cells use the right mouse button
  - when you're done press space and watch the magic happen
- when the game is done or you don't have patience press the R key to restart the game and you can play again
